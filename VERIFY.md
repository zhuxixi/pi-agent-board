# Manual Verification

Steps you can run yourself to check the extension. Grouped from "no auth needed" to
"needs pi provider auth". Commands assume you're in the repo root.

---

## 0. Static checks (no auth, fast)

```bash
npm install          # dev + runtime deps
npm run typecheck    # expect: 0 errors
npm test             # expect: 0 failures
npm run pack:dry     # expect: pi-agent-board-<version>.tgz contents only include deploy files
```

`npm test` includes a hermetic integration test that runs the **real detached runner** against
a fake pi worker (`test-support/fake-pi.mjs`) — it proves dispatch → events → status/state →
finalize (completed / needs_input / failed / stopped) without any model/network.

## 1. Does the extension load in pi? (no auth)

```bash
pi --list-models -e "$(pwd)/src/index.ts"
```
Expect a normal model table and **exit 0** (the extension factory ran without throwing). If you
see an error mentioning `index.ts` / jiti / a missing import, that's a load problem.

## 2. CRITICAL: can pi reach a model at all? (needs pi auth)

This is the thing that was blocked in the dev sandbox. The background worker is just
`pi --mode json -p --session <file> "<prompt>"`, so first confirm a plain one-shot works:

```bash
# Should print a JSON event stream that ENDS WITH a line of type "agent_end", then exit
# within a few seconds. Watch for an "assistant" message_end before agent_end.
pi --mode json -p --no-session "Reply with exactly: DONE" | tail -n 20
```
- ✅ **Healthy:** you see `...message_end (assistant)...`, then `agent_end`, and the command exits.
- ❌ **Hang:** it prints up to a `message_end` for the **user** message then sits idle (no
  assistant reply, never exits). That means pi has no working provider auth / network here.
  Fix pi's auth first:
  ```bash
  pi            # then run /login inside pi, or set the provider key pi expects, e.g.
  # export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...   (or OPENAI_API_KEY=... for gpt-4o summaries)
  ```
  Re-run the one-shot above until it ends in `agent_end`. The dashboard cannot show live results
  until this works — it's a pi setup step, independent of this extension.

## 3. Install the extension for normal use

For a local checkout, install it as a Pi package:
```bash
pi install "$(pwd)"
```
Or symlink the repo into pi's global extensions dir (auto-discovered via the top-level `index.ts`):
```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)" ~/.pi/agent/extensions/agent-board
```
After publish, install with:
```bash
pi install npm:@zhuxixi/pi-agent-board
```
Then start pi normally:
```bash
pi
```

## 4. Drive the dashboard

Inside pi:
1. Type `/agent-board`, or start with `pi /agent-board` → the full-screen dashboard opens.
   - With `pi /agent-board`, quitting the dashboard exits Pi instead of dropping you into a normal chat session.
   - The startup path should feel cleaner than `/agent-board`: no normal Pi header/footer chrome and no dispatch notifications above the dashboard.
2. Type a task in the bottom input (e.g. `list the files in this repo and summarize the README`), then press **Enter**.
   - A **Start session** dialog opens with **Start session** focused by default.
   - Press **Enter** again to launch immediately, or move with **↑/↓** to change **cwd**, **model**, or **thinking** first.
   - A row appears and moves `Queued → Running → Done` (needs step 2 healthy).
3. **space** = peek when the input is empty (summary, blocker, latest output); in peek **r** = reply, **a** = attach.
   **→** / **>** = open a full-screen live session view without interrupting; **←** / **<** returns.
4. **enter** on an empty input = attach to the selected full session (confirms first if it's still running).
   You're now in the real Pi session; run `/agent-board` again to return.
5. Other keys: **/** filter (`s:running`, or free text), **Ctrl+R** rename, **Ctrl+T** pin, **Ctrl+S** stop,
   **Ctrl+X** delete (archives the row, keeps the session file), **?** help, **Esc** clears input / quits when empty.

## 5. Inspect the durable store on disk

```bash
ls -R ~/.pi/agent/agent-board
cat ~/.pi/agent/agent-board/roster.json
cat ~/.pi/agent/agent-board/views/*/state.json
cat ~/.pi/agent/agent-board/views/*/runs/*/status.json
# raw worker event stream for a run:
cat ~/.pi/agent/agent-board/views/*/runs/*/events.jsonl
```

## 6. Recovery / persistence

- Start a dispatch, then quit pi (or `/reload`). Re-open pi and `/agent-board` — the row is still
  there with its last state (rehydrated from disk). If a run's runner died without finishing,
  the dashboard reconciles it to `failed (runner exited)` on open.

## 7. Same-repo session launches

- Dispatch one task in a git repo, then (while it's running) dispatch a second in the
  **same repo**. Both launches should be allowed. The extension never creates a git worktree on
  its own.

## 8. Summary model

Default summary model is **gpt-4o** (override `AGENT_BOARD_SUMMARY_MODEL=<model>`, disable with
`AGENT_BOARD_SUMMARY_MODEL=off`; legacy `AGENT_VIEW_SUMMARY_MODEL` is also honored). It needs OpenAI auth; without it the row keeps its heuristic
summary (e.g. the first sentence of the agent's last message or the active tool).
